Control Lights through clapping twice project.

Currently Working:
- waveform and fft visualizer based on computer built in microphone.
- Determination of peak frequency.

In Progress:
- Algorithm to determine clap sound in time and frequency domains.
- Networking to control remote microcontroller and switch over ethernet or serial

Errata:
- microphone saturates and throws off frequency analysis.
